# What is the game?
In this game you are getting the chance of having the probably best job on earth: You are the Eismann. You have the power to make all students happy. Or unhappy. It depends on you being tough enough to get this job done or not.

You are playing in a 1st person perspective. You are inside the ice cream van, being confronted with students arriving as customers at the van’s window ordering their individual favorite flavoured ice cream. 

You now have to take a waffle, grab scoops of ice cream and place them on it, hand it over to the waiting student and get your cash. But beware: Time is running out! Get as many orders served as possible in the given time. The gameplay will be a mixture of memory game, simulation, dexterity and action arcade.
